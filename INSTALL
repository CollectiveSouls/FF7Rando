Future Use / Installation
============================
- Rip a disc image (iso) of your Final Fantasy VII discs.
- Go to File on the menu bar and open the directory with your three ripped disc images.
- Select your options in the randomizer and/or put in a seed.
- Hit the generate button, which will create isos with the approrpiate files modified.
- Burn disc images for use with a modded PSX/PS2 (recommended) or emulator (faster, but less accurate.)
