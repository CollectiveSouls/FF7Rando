Character Randomization
-----------------------
	Characters can be randomized based on a generated seed or can be chosen manually 
(feature to come). Once the order in which the characters has been generated 
(including who the Controllable character himself is), the program will match the 
characters attributes to them (Level map, Limit breaks, moves). 

	The changing of the controllable character (normally Cloud) will have graphical 
glitches in animations. This is because most other characters have a different bone count
than Cloud, this is a problem since this will cause bones to move which usually should 
not be. Note this is only the case for Field specific animations which are specific to that
screen(Ladder climbing, Cloud jumping off the train in the intro, etc).
